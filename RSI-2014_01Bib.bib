  Abstract                 = {Several optimization criteria for column heating rate in temperature
programmed gas chromatography ŽGC., under different optimization constraints
are identified. Applying these criteria to experimental data, it is shown that when
column pressure drop is high, the optimum heating rate for n-alkanes and
pesticides in a column with a silicone stationary phase of a typical thickness is
about 10C per void time. This heating rate is recommended as a default for all
temperature programs in capillary GC.},

  Abstract                 = {A porous layer open tubular (PLOT) silica gel column was used together with subcritical CO2 as the mobile phase to effect the group separation of polar oxygenated compounds. Aliphatic and aromatic compounds were shown to elute together. This group was followed by ethers and aldehydes, which were separated from compounds containing an alcohol functional group. Compounds with a carboxylic acid moiety could also be eluted from the silica gel. The group separation obtained when a silica gel PLOT column is used together with subcritical CO2 was also demonstrated to be valuable as the first dimension of a comprehensive two-dimensional SFCxGC analysis where the GC analysis in the second dimension is performed with a fast and independently heated temperature programmed gas chromatograph. With this combination of SFC and GC, many of the oxygenated compounds, routinely found in petroleum samples, could successfully be separated and identified.},

  Abstract                 = {With comprehensive two-dimensional supercritical fluid and fast, independent temperature-programmed gas chromatography (SFCxGC), a polar column was used in the first dimension to achieve group-type analysis. The eluent of this separation was repetitively sampled and transferred to a fast, resistively heated gas chromatograph to obtain the boiling point distribution over the entire polarity separation. The SFC was operated isothermally with stopped flow to provide a sufficient time span for the GC analysis. The GC analysis had a typical cycle time of 1 min for the system demonstrated here. During this time, the GC column was independently heated at a rate of 450 degrees C/min to 250 degrees C and actively cooled again to -50 degrees C before the next GC injection took place. The analysis of petrochemical samples is presented to illustrate the technique.},
